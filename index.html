<h1>TITLE</h1>

<p>Founded by Takahiro Miyashita in 1996, Number (N)ine is a Japanese fashion brand that created clothing inspired by American culture (Americana), military garments, and rock music. The brand was active for 12 strong years and cultivated a massive following in the fashion community.

<p>One aspect of the brand's appeal within the archive fashion scene is its limited supply due to its short existence, having closed its doors after its Autumn Winter 2009 show but occasionally cropping up with the occasional capsule drop. This has contributed to consistent rising prices, as demand increases and supply diminishes over time.

<p>Number (N)ine was often criticised for being unoriginal and derivative but it is hard to ignore Miyashita obsessive attention to detail, you will notice a lot of distressing on their tees and most garments will have music notes sewn into the interior.
